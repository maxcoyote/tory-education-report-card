    **Funding**

    The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that total school spending per pupil has fallen by 8% in real terms between 2009–10 and 2017–18. School sixth forms have faced budget cuts of 21% per student since their peak in 2010–11, while further education and sixth-form college funding per student has fallen by about 8% over the same period.

    Would a government that you lead prioritise reversing these cuts to education funding?

    **Assessment**

    From next year, primary school pupils will face baseline assessment in reception year and high stakes standardised tests in years 1, 2, 4 and 6.

    Do you agree with teachers that there is too much testing in schools and that our high stakes testing regime is causing damage to the mental health and wellbeing of children and teachers alike?

    **Workload**

    Over half of teachers report that their workload has actually increased since the launch of the Government’s ‘Workload Challenge’ in 2014.

    What would a government led by you do to reduce teacher workload?

    **Pay**

    Pay freezes and pay caps have cut teachers’ pay by some 15% since 2010.

    Do you support the NEU’s call that for September 2019 there is a fully funded pay increase of 5 per cent for all teachers and school leaders?

    **Privatisation**

    The NEU believes that education is a public service and a public good, not a commodity to be bought and sold.

    Will you rule out the idea of schools being run for profit?

    **Child poverty**

    New figures released by the End Child Poverty coalition show that half a million more children are having their lives limited by poverty today than at the start of the decade.

    Do you agree that it should be the job of government to develop and deliver an ambitious and credible child-poverty reduction strategy?

Conservative Leadership candidates have been making wild promises on education so The National Education Union asked the Conservative Leadership Candidates a series of questions to hold them to their word. None of them responded, which makes us ask what are they hiding on education?
